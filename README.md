## About this project

_Note: Development of this project intermittent_

The objective of this project was to enhance my development skill by building a full-stack application. If viable I attempt to treat any given project as if it is meant to go live at some point. This project was no different. Therefore, I wanted the various aspects of this application to be clearly separated thereby enabling the scalability of features. For example one possible future state objective is an accompanying Chrome extension. Many of the features are implied in the [user stories](https://github.com/LucasZapico/quotible-react-frontend/blob/master/project.md).
